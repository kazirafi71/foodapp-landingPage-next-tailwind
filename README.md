<h2>Build A Next JS Website Styled With Tailwind CSS</h2>

This was a fun little project consisting of Nextjs & Tailwind which is a super powerful frontend combination you can used to quickly build websites. In this build I focus on adding a little extra javascript with the array filter method to filter out specific food types and pricing categories.
